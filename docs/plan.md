# PORTFOLIO PLAN

1. Home
   - Header with logo on left and navigation links on right (They will lead to each section on the same page - not links to other pages)
   - Hero section (full screen background image with title and subtitle centered - call to action button)
   - Introduction (A small text section along with an image next to it. - transparent background behind image)
   - Book timeline (section with book covers and years below them - vertical line connecting them - a few words about each book next to each cover)
   - Services (A section with cards for each service offered - hover effect on cards - modern animations)
   - Contact form at the bottom of page (name, email, message - simple and clean design)
   - 9 featured articles/blog posts with images and titles in carousel format.
   - Footer with social media links and copyright information
2. Design elements
   - Color scheme: modern and clean (light gray, lilac)
   - Custom Logo: Developer will provide it.
   - Typography: Developer will provide it. (Create custom font family so future changes to font can be done easily site wide)
   - Animations: smooth transitions and hover effects on buttons and cards. Animations should apply on scroll for sections appearing into view.
3. Responsiveness
   - The website must be fully responsive and look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
   - Navigation menu should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
4. DEV configs
   - Create content config from json files for easy future updates to content. I want no hardcoded text in the components.
   - Set up eslint with recommended rules for Vue.js
   - Set up prettier for code formatting
   - Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks to run linting and formatting checks
   - Configure vs code extensions to follow eslint and prettier rules
